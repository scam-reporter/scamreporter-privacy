    <h1>ScamReporter Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: November 30, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>What is ScamReporter?</h2>
    <p>Have you ever received strange text messages from unknown numbers saying things like "How have you been?" or "What time are you picking me up?" These are smishing attacks — scams delivered through SMS.</p>
    <p>ScamReporter helps you report these scammers to mobile carriers quickly and easily.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>WE DO NOT SAVE ANY INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>This app does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information to our servers. <strong>We don't even have servers.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>What Data Stays on Your Device</h2>
    <p>You MAY choose to save locally (on your device only):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name (optional - for signing reports)</li>
        <li>Your phone number (optional - included in reports)</li>
        <li>API keys for carrier lookup services</li>
        <li>App settings and preferences</li>
        <li>Report history (past reports you've sent)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>All of this data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stays only on your iPhone</li>
        <li>Is stored securely using iOS Keychain</li>
        <li>Is never transmitted to us</li>
        <li>Can be deleted anytime</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>You Can Leave Everything Blank</h2>
    <p>You can use ScamReporter without saving any personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Just enter the scammer's number</li>
        <li>Lookup the carrier</li>
        <li>Manually enter your details in the email if you want</li>
        <li>We only need the offending number to lookup carrier info</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Transmission</h2>
    <p>The ONLY data that leaves your device:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>When you tap "Lookup Carrier":</strong> The scammer's phone number is sent to your chosen API provider (Many of these are freee - AbstractAPI, Numverify, CarrierLookup.com, or IPQualityScore) to identify the carrier</li>
        <li><strong>When you send an email:</strong> The report you choose to send goes through your email app</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>If you use carrier lookup APIs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AbstractAPI, Numverify, CarrierLookup.com, and IPQualityScore have their own privacy policies</li>
        <li>Only the phone number you're looking up is sent to them</li>
        <li>You control which services to use</li>
        <li>API keys are stored securely on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
    <p>We do not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Track your usage</li>
        <li>Collect analytics</li>
        <li>Use cookies</li>
        <li>Monitor your activity</li>
        <li>Sell or share any data (because we don't have any!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Control</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete all app data:</strong> Settings → Clear All Data</li>
        <li><strong>Don't save personal info:</strong> Just use the lookup feature</li>
        <li><strong>Choose which APIs to use:</strong> Configure only the ones you trust</li>
        <li><strong>Uninstall anytime:</strong> All local data is removed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reporting Mistakes</h2>
    <p>Don't worry about accidentally reporting legitimate wrong-number texts. Carriers have systems to distinguish fraud patterns from genuine messages.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>ScamReporter does not knowingly collect data from anyone, adults or children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <hr>
    <p><strong>Your Privacy Matters</strong></p>
    <p>ScamReporter was built with privacy as the #1 priority. We believe you should control your own data, which is why we never see it in the first place.</p>
